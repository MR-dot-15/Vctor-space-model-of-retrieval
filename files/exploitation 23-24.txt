Right against exploitation
The Right against exploitation contained in Articles 23â€“24, lays down certain provisions to prevent exploitation of the weaker sections of the society by individuals or the State.[45] Article 23 prohibits human trafficking, making it an offence punishable by law, and also prohibits forced labour or any act of compelling a person to work without wages where he was legally entitled not to work or to receive remuneration for it. However, it permits the State to impose compulsory service for public purposes, including conscription and community service.[46][47] The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, has been enacted by Parliament to give effect to this Article.[48] Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in factories, mines and other hazardous jobs. Parliament has enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, providing regulations for the abolition of, and penalties for employing, child labour, as well as provisions for rehabilitation of former child labourers.
